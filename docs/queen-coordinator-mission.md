# QUEEN COORDINATOR - AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM REVIEW

## MISSION BRIEFING

**CRITICAL ISSUE**: Users authenticating through Google sign-on are redirected back to sign-on screen instead of reaching onboarding page.

## AGENTS SPAWNED

### 1. CODER AGENT - Implementation Specialist
**Role**: Direct code implementation and deployment coordination
**Focus**: Fix authentication flow and session management issues

### 2. REFACTOR AGENT - Code Optimization Specialist  
**Role**: Comprehensive code review and optimization
**Focus**: Authentication architecture improvements and security hardening

### 3. SECURITY AGENT - Security Systems Specialist
**Role**: Security vulnerability assessment and OAuth flow validation
**Focus**: Authentication security analysis and session protection

## INVESTIGATION TARGETS

Based on initial code analysis, investigate these critical areas:

1. **Google OAuth Callback Processing** (`/api/auth/callback/google/route.ts`)
   - Token exchange and user info retrieval
   - Session creation after OAuth success
   - Cookie setting and redirect logic

2. **Session Management** (`useAuth.ts` hook)
   - Session restoration from cookies
   - Token validation and refresh
   - Cross-tab session synchronization

3. **Authentication Wrapper** (`AuthWrapper.tsx`)
   - User state management
   - Onboarding redirect logic
   - Loading states and timeouts

4. **Onboarding Page Access** (`/onboarding/page.tsx`)
   - Authentication requirements
   - Session validation
   - Profile completion flow

## COORDINATION PROTOCOL

All agents will work in parallel to:
1. Identify the exact authentication failure point
2. Diagnose session persistence issues
3. Validate OAuth callback flow
4. Test user creation and profile setup
5. Ensure proper redirect handling

## DELIVERABLE

Comprehensive authentication diagnosis report with:
- Root cause analysis
- Specific failure points
- Recommended fixes
- Security improvements
- Implementation roadmap
