-- Clear Authentication Users Script
-- This specifically targets the auth.users table and related auth data
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This will require fresh user registration

-- Step 1: Clear auth-related tables in correct order (to avoid foreign key issues)
SELECT 'Clearing authentication data...' as status;

-- Clear refresh tokens first
DELETE FROM auth.refresh_tokens;
SELECT 'Cleared refresh tokens: ' || ROW_COUNT() as result;

-- Clear user sessions
DELETE FROM auth.sessions;
SELECT 'Cleared sessions: ' || ROW_COUNT() as result;

-- Clear identity links (OAuth connections)
DELETE FROM auth.identities;
SELECT 'Cleared identities: ' || ROW_COUNT() as result;

-- Clear audit log entries (if exists)
DELETE FROM auth.audit_log_entries WHERE TRUE;

-- Finally clear the users table (this will cascade to public schema foreign keys)
DELETE FROM auth.users;
SELECT 'Cleared users: ' || ROW_COUNT() as result;

-- Step 2: Reset any user-related sequences (optional)
-- Uncomment if you want to reset auto-incrementing values
-- ALTER SEQUENCE IF EXISTS auth.refresh_tokens_id_seq RESTART WITH 1;
-- ALTER SEQUENCE IF EXISTS auth.audit_log_entries_id_seq RESTART WITH 1;

-- Step 3: Verification
SELECT 'Authentication clearing completed!' as status;

-- Show what's left in auth schema
