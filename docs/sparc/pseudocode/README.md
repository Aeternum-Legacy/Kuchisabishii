# Kuchisabishii - SPARC Pseudocode Phase Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the complete pseudocode specifications for the Kuchisabishii emotional food journaling system, developed using the SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) methodology. The algorithms focus on emotional intelligence, cross-platform functionality, and personalized food discovery.

## Phase Completion Status

✅ **SPARC Pseudocode Phase Complete**

All core algorithmic components have been designed with detailed pseudocode implementations, complexity analysis, and technical considerations.

## Core Algorithm Documentation

### 1. [Emotional Rating System](./emotional-rating-system.md)
**Purpose**: Convert subjective emotional food experiences into quantifiable data structures

**Key Features**:
- "Never Again" to "When My Mouth is Lonely" emotional scale (0-4)
- Multi-dimensional emotional analysis (satisfaction, craving, comfort, excitement)
- Temporal emotion tracking with pattern recognition
- Contextual mood integration and bias adjustment

**Complexity**: O(1) time, O(1) space per rating
**Scalability**: Linear with concurrent users

### 2. [Cross-Platform Data Synchronization](./cross-platform-sync.md)
**Purpose**: Offline-first synchronization between React Native and Next.js with intelligent conflict resolution

**Key Features**:
- Conflict resolution for emotional data with temporal precedence
- Progressive sync prioritization based on network conditions
- Emotional rating merging with confidence weighting
- Delta synchronization for bandwidth optimization

**Complexity**: O(n log n) time, O(n) space where n = pending operations
**Scalability**: Bounded by network bandwidth and conflict resolution complexity

### 3. [Food Experience Capture Flow](./food-experience-capture.md)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive media capture and processing pipeline with real-time emotional state detection

**Key Features**:
- Multi-modal emotion detection (facial expressions, voice, gestures)
- Real-time media quality assessment and guidance
- Metadata extraction and contextual enrichment
- Privacy-preserving on-device processing

**Complexity**: O(n²) time for CNN processing, O(m) space for media assets
**Scalability**: Limited by GPU/CPU for real-time processing

### 4. [Recommendation Engine](./recommendation-engine.md)
**Purpose**: Intelligent recommendation system with personal taste evolution and collaborative filtering

**Key Features**:
- Personal taste evolution tracking with adaptive learning rates
- Collaborative filtering with emotional similarity weights
- Context-aware suggestion generation (mood, time, social)
- Multi-strategy recommendation fusion (taste, collaborative, novelty)

**Complexity**: O(n * m * d) time where n = candidates, m = dimensions, d = data points
**Scalability**: Quadratic bottleneck at ~100K users, requires LSH optimization

### 5. [Social Intelligence Matching](./social-intelligence-matching.md)
**Purpose**: Advanced "Taste Twin" matching with privacy-preserving social features

**Key Features**:
- Multi-dimensional similarity scoring (taste, emotional, behavioral, contextual)
- Privacy-by-design architecture with differential privacy
- Contextual social matching for group dining decisions
- Group dynamics analysis and satisfaction prediction

**Complexity**: O(n * m * d) for matching, O(V + E) for graph operations
**Scalability**: Graph algorithms limit to ~1M users, requires distributed processing

### 6. [Restaurant vs Home-cooked Logic](./restaurant-vs-home-logic.md)
**Purpose**: Context detection system differentiating dining experiences with location-based intelligence

**Key Features**:
- Multi-modal context detection (location, visual, temporal, behavioral)
- Restaurant detection with menu item matching
- Home cooking workflow with skill assessment and recipe matching
- Context-aware experience workflows

**Complexity**: O(n * m) for classification, O(r * v) for restaurant matching
**Scalability**: Restaurant database size is primary bottleneck

### 7. [Search and Discovery Algorithms](./search-discovery-algorithms.md)
**Purpose**: Semantic search with emotional context and mood-based personalized discovery

**Key Features**:
- Semantic search with food domain embeddings
- Mood-based discovery with emotional regulation strategies
- Temporal recommendation patterns and seasonal awareness
- Serendipity injection and exploration boundary management

**Complexity**: O(n * d) for vector search, O(m * f) for mood discovery
**Scalability**: Vector search scales logarithmically with LSH optimization

## Emotional Intelligence Differentiation

This system's unique emotional intelligence approach includes:

1. **Emotional Scale Innovation**: The "Never Again" to "When My Mouth is Lonely" scale captures nuanced food relationships beyond simple ratings

2. **Multi-Dimensional Emotional Analysis**: Separates satisfaction, craving, comfort, excitement, and nostalgia as independent emotional dimensions

3. **Temporal Emotional Tracking**: Recognizes that food emotions evolve over time (immediate vs. reflective ratings)

4. **Contextual Emotional Intelligence**: Integrates mood, social context, and environmental factors into food recommendations

5. **Emotional Conflict Resolution**: Special handling for synchronized emotional data across devices with confidence-based merging

6. **Privacy-Preserving Emotional Analytics**: Differential privacy for emotional insights while maintaining personalization quality

## Technical Architecture Highlights

### Performance Characteristics
- **Real-time Targets**: <100ms emotional rating, <500ms experience capture, <1s recommendations
- **Scalability Limits**: 100K users (recommendation engine), 1M users (social features), 10M+ experiences
- **Memory Usage**: 144 bytes per rating, 65MB peak during capture, 500MB+ for recommendation models

### Cross-Platform Strategy
- **Shared Business Logic**: TypeScript modules for core algorithms
- **Platform-Specific Optimizations**: React Native for mobile, Next.js for web
- **Offline-First Design**: Full functionality without network, eventual consistency

### Privacy and Security
- **Field-Level Encryption**: Sensitive emotional data encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- **Differential Privacy**: Aggregated insights with mathematically proven privacy guarantees
- **Privacy-by-Design**: Granular user controls and transparent data usage

## Next Phase: Architecture

This pseudocode phase provides the algorithmic foundation for the next SPARC phase: **Architecture Design**. The detailed algorithms will be translated into:
