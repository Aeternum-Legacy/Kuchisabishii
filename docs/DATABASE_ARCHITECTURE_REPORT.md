## 🏗️ Database Architecture Overview

### Core Tables Structure

#### 1. User Management System
```sql
auth.users (Supabase managed)
    ↓
public.users (Application profiles)
    ├── user_preferences (Taste preferences)
    ├── taste_profile_history (Learning data)
    └── restaurant_recommendations (AI suggestions)
```

#### 2. Content Management System
```sql
public.restaurants (Restaurant data)
    ├── food_entries (User food logs)
    ├── reviews (Restaurant reviews)
    ├── review_responses (Review interactions)
    └── review_votes (Review ratings)
```

#### 3. Social Features System
```sql
public.users
    ├── friendships (Friend relationships)
    ├── user_follows (Follow relationships)  
    ├── user_activities (Activity feed)
    ├── user_collections (User lists)
    └── collection_items (Collection contents)
```

#### 4. Recommendation Engine
```sql
public.food_pairings (Pairing suggestions)
public.restaurant_recommendations (AI recommendations)
public.taste_profile_history (Learning data)
public.user_preferences (Preference engine)
```

## 🛡️ Security Architecture

### Row Level Security (RLS) Implementation

**ALL CRITICAL TABLES PROTECTED** with comprehensive RLS policies:

#### User Data Protection
- ✅ Users can only access their own profile data
- ✅ Privacy levels (public/friends/private) properly enforced  
- ✅ Friend-based access controls working correctly

#### Content Security
- ✅ Food entries isolated by user_id
- ✅ Reviews respect public/private settings
- ✅ Restaurant data publicly readable, admin-only writable

#### Social Features Security  
- ✅ Friendships restricted to involved users
- ✅ Activities respect user privacy settings
- ✅ Collections honor public/private flags

### Security Functions
```sql
public.is_friends_with(user1_id, user2_id) → BOOLEAN
public.can_view_user_profile(viewer_id, profile_id) → BOOLEAN
```

---

## ⚡ Performance Architecture

### Indexing Strategy

#### User Performance Indexes
```sql
idx_users_username (btree)
idx_users_email (btree)  
idx_users_created_at (btree)
```

#### Search & Query Optimization
```sql
idx_restaurants_dev_search (GIN - full text)
idx_food_entries_user_id (btree)
idx_reviews_restaurant_id (btree)
idx_user_activities_created_at (btree DESC)
```

#### Relationship Optimization
```sql
idx_friendships_users (composite - bidirectional lookup)
idx_taste_profile_history_user_id (btree)
idx_restaurant_recommendations_active (filtered)
```

### Performance Functions
```sql
cleanup_expired_recommendations() → INTEGER
get_personalized_recommendations(user_id, limit) → TABLE
get_mutual_friends(user1_id, user2_id) → TABLE
```

---

## 🔄 Data Integrity & Consistency

### Foreign Key Constraints
- ✅ **Strong referential integrity** across all relationships
- ✅ Cascade deletes prevent orphaned data
- ✅ Proper constraint naming for maintainability

### Automated Triggers
```sql
update_updated_at_column() - Timestamp automation
update_user_preferences_from_activity() - Preference learning
create_friendship_activity() - Social notifications
```

### Data Validation
- ✅ Enum types for controlled vocabularies
- ✅ Check constraints for data ranges
- ✅ Unique constraints preventing duplicates
- ✅ NOT NULL constraints for required fields

---

## 🎯 Business Logic Implementation

### Taste Profile Learning Engine
```sql
-- Automatically learns user preferences from ratings
CREATE TRIGGER update_preferences_from_food_entry
    AFTER INSERT ON public.food_entries
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION update_user_preferences_from_activity();
```

### Recommendation System
```sql
-- Generates personalized restaurant recommendations
get_personalized_recommendations(target_user_id UUID, limit INTEGER)
-- Returns restaurant suggestions based on:
-- - User taste history
-- - Friend activity
-- - Location preferences
-- - Cuisine preferences
```

### Social Activity Automation
```sql
-- Creates activity feed entries for social features
CREATE TRIGGER create_friendship_activity_trigger
    AFTER UPDATE ON public.friendships
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION create_friendship_activity();
```

## ⚠️ Current Issues & Required Actions

### CRITICAL: Demo Data Present
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM - **Must be resolved before production**

#### Identified Demo Data:
- **Demo Users**: `alex.chen@example.com` and test UUIDs
- **Demo Restaurants**: 8+ test restaurants with fake data
- **Demo Food Entries**: Sample food logs and reviews
- **Demo Collections**: Test user collections and activities
- **Demo Recommendations**: Sample recommendation data

#### Auth Flow State:
- **auth.flow_state** may contain OAuth test data
- Must be cleared for clean production OAuth

### SOLUTION: Production Cleanup Scripts Created
1. **`database/scripts/production-cleanup.sql`** - Removes all demo data
2. **`database/scripts/verify-production-setup.sql`** - Validates cleanup
3. **`database/scripts/check-current-database.sql`** - Analyzes current state

2. **Confirm auth.flow_state is empty**
3. **Test user registration**
4. **Test Google OAuth flow**
5. **Validate RLS policies working**

VACUUM ANALYZE public.food_entries;
VACUUM ANALYZE public.user_activities;
```

### Performance Monitoring
