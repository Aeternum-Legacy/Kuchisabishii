ok auto-spawn a hive with a queen to coordinate the condinuted development of the platform in the local drive (don't commit to git) and test in our local server. I want
  the following developed:
  -For food that a user has already recorded an experience in, alow the user to select the "eat again" option to upload new version of their experience record. All verseions
  of their records are kept for the user to review. The "eat again" function will let users record:
  i. image/videa
  ii. date eaten
  iii. location (same or choose new)
  iv. the meal time: breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner
  v. did you eat at home/dine in/take out/ or get delivery?
  vi. how much did it cost this time?
  vii. what was your experience this time? (text input max character 4096)
  viii. 5 experience selections: I wish i could eat it... never again, not as much anymore, just as much as before, more often than I had, whenever my mouth is lonely
  (kuchisabishii!). If the previous selection was already Kuchisabishii!, then the "just as much as before" option will save it as the "Kuchisabishii!" experience.

  - Then add the profile function allowing users to upload their photo, add/manage friends, see what other friends are eating based on their reviews, and other profile
  related info that you think such an app should have.

  - Then add the function to recommend foods for self or for group. The group function allows users to choose a friend and the system will determine the kind of pallet
  between all users to recommend dishes. It also has the function for both the self recommended and group recommended function recommend specific food/drinks based on options
   that the user can select: food or drink, type of shop, a specific shop(s), food type, restaurant type, cuisine, diatery restrictions, location, meal time, and whether
  delivery/take out/dine in/home cooking. The group option should allow users to createa group and add friends. The group admin can trigger a food hunt request which everyone
   can optionally enter all the different food preferences above in order to generate a recommendation to the admin. The admin can then select the food recommendation(s) and
  then the group can vote on the choices.

  Build all this and let me test it."


Yes, add in phas 5 but also add in user profile and all the functions that a user will need on their profile inlcuding tabs to show the complete list of foods they had reviewed and can sort/filter them as they like. Also please add a user onboarding using AI LLM capabilities where the user is guided through a series of questions to build their pallet profile so the system can start recommending foods (questions could include: are you a sweet tooth? what cuisine do you like - top 5? do you like spicy food? how spicy would you say you can handle - none, mild, spicy, super spicy, and face melting level of spice? and come up with 2 more questions to test). Design the algorithm and create a log for potential patenting on what the algorithm is in: defining a user's pallet profile, how their ongoing food reviews will adjust the pallet profile, how we determine suitable foods to recommend based on their pallet profile, and how we use the pallet profile to match with other users of similar pallet profiles and recommend foods based on user reviews of foods from users that have at least 90% match in pallet profiles. Also, the sign up function seems to be broken and not allowing just anyone to sign up and authenticate using the email. Next please configure the google and apply sign in functions. Decide whether it makes sense to run an auto-swarm hive to perform parts of this prompt, all of this prompt, or use linear to do it all. Also, the UI/UX and color pallet is not very nice. Please put on the hat of a also initiate research on the best UI/US designs of 2025 that match a fun and cute user experience to redesign and implement on the app. Prompt me if you need further clarifications in every step.
