-- AUTHENTICATION ONLY Reset Script
-- This clears ONLY the auth.users data for fresh registration
-- Preserves all other data structures
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: You will need to re-register accounts

SELECT 'üîê Clearing authentication data only...' as status;

-- Method 1: Clear ALL authentication accounts
-- Uncomment this for complete auth reset:
DELETE FROM auth.refresh_tokens;
DELETE FROM auth.sessions; 
DELETE FROM auth.identities;
DELETE FROM auth.users; -- This will cascade and clear related profile data too

-- Method 2: Clear only non-admin accounts (SAFER)
-- Comment out Method 1 and uncomment this for safer reset:
/*
