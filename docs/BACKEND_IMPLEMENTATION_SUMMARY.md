# Kuchisabishii Backend Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully implemented the core backend infrastructure for Kuchisabishii, a food journaling and recommendation PWA. The backend is built using Next.js 15 with Supabase as the primary database and authentication provider.

## ✅ Completed Components

**Database Schema:**
- Complete emotional food journaling schema with 13 core tables
- Advanced taste profiling with 11-dimension taste analysis
- Social features (friendships, sharing, recommendations)
- Analytics tracking and user behavior insights
- Full-text search optimization with tsvector indexes

### 2. Authentication System

**API Routes:**

- Menu item management and categorization

### 6. Utility Infrastructure

**Middleware & Helpers:**
- `src/lib/middleware/auth.ts` - Authentication middleware with rate limiting

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Emotional-First Data Model
The database is designed around capturing the complete emotional and sensory food experience:
- **5 Basic Tastes**: Salt, sweet, sour, bitter, umami (1-10 scales)
- **4 Texture Categories**: Crunchy, creamy, chewy, juicy
- **Environmental Factors**: Temperature, spice heat, aroma intensity
- **Emotional Context**: Mood before/after, satisfaction levels, social context

### Privacy & Social Features
- Three-tier privacy system: Private, Friends, Public
- Granular sharing controls per experience
- Friend system with request/accept workflow
- Social feed with friend activity aggregation

### Performance & Scalability
- PostgreSQL with full-text search indexes
- Optimized queries with proper JOIN strategies
- Pagination support for all list endpoints
- Connection pooling and query caching ready
- Geographic indexing for location-based searches

### Type Safety
- Comprehensive TypeScript definitions
- Zod validation schemas for all API inputs
- Type-safe database operations with Supabase
- API response type definitions
