# Kuchisabishii App Icon Design Brief

## 🎨 Design Concept

Create a **pink fluffy adorable anime-style animal** that embodies the essence of "Kuchisabishii" (口さびしい) - the feeling when your mouth is lonely and craves something delicious.

## 📋 Design Requirements

- **Color Palette**: Soft pink as primary color with complementary pastels
- **Style**: Anime/kawaii aesthetic with large expressive eyes
- **Expression**: Slightly pouty or longing expression that captures "mouth loneliness"

### Emotional Expression
The character should convey:

### Visual Elements
1. **Primary Character**: 
   - Large, expressive eyes (typical anime style)
   - Soft pink fur/body with gradient shading
   - Small mouth slightly open or with tiny tongue showing
   - Fluffy texture details
   
2. **Food Elements** (optional accents):
