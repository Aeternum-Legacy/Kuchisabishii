# AI-Powered Recommendation Engine for Kuchisabishii\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThe Kuchisabishii recommendation engine represents a breakthrough in emotionally-intelligent food discovery technology. Unlike traditional recommendation systems that focus purely on ratings and preferences, our engine integrates deep emotional understanding with advanced machine learning to create recommendations that feel personal and meaningful rather than algorithmic.\n\n## Core Philosophy: Emotional Palate Evolution\n\nOur system is built around the concept that food choices are deeply emotional experiences that evolve over time. The engine recognizes that when someone says \"I'm feeling kuchisabishii\" (when your mouth is lonely), they need more than just a highly-rated restaurant – they need an emotionally resonant food experience.\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### 1.
