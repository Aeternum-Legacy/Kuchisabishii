# Your Emotional Food Journey with Kuchisabishii

Welcome to Kuchisabishii - an app that understands that food is more than fuel. It's comfort, memory, adventure, and sometimes, the cure for "mouth loneliness."

## What is "Kuchisabishii"?

**Kuchisabishii** (Âè£ÂØÇ„Åó„ÅÑ) is a beautiful Japanese word that describes the feeling of wanting to eat not because you're hungry, but because your mouth feels lonely. It's that urge to eat when you're bored, sad, or need emotional comfort.

We've built this app around the understanding that your relationship with food is deeply personal and emotional.

## Getting Started

### 1. Welcome & Setup

When you first open Kuchisabishii, we'll ask about:
- Your dietary preferences and restrictions
- Foods that make you feel comfortable
- Your eating patterns and goals

*Don't worry - you can change these anytime as you learn more about yourself.*

### 2. Your First Food Experience

Start by logging a meal you just had or one you remember fondly:

**Basic Information:**
- What did you eat?
- Where did you eat it?
- When did you eat it?
- How much did it cost?

**The Emotional Part:**
This is where Kuchisabishii shines. We'll ask:
- How did you feel before eating?
- How did you feel after?
- Were you eating alone or with others?
- What was the occasion?

## The Emotional Rating System

### Understanding Your Emotions

Instead of simple star ratings, we capture six emotional dimensions:

1. **Satisfaction** (1-10): How satisfied did this meal make you feel?
2. **Craving** (1-10): How much would you crave this again?
3. **Comfort** (1-10): How much comfort did this food provide?
4. **Excitement** (1-10): How adventurous or exciting was this?
5. **Nostalgia** (0-10): Did this trigger any memories?
6. **Social** (0-10): How did this enhance social connection?

### The 5-Point Emotional Scale

Based on your emotional dimensions, we calculate your overall feeling:

üî¥ **Never again** - *This didn't speak to my soul*
- When food disappoints on an emotional level
- Left you feeling unsatisfied or regretful

üü† **Disappointed** - *Left my mouth wanting*
- Expected more emotional satisfaction
- Technically fine, but emotionally lacking

üü° **Neutral** - *Filled the space but didn't fill the longing*
- Met basic needs without emotional impact
- Functional but not memorable

üü¢ **Satisfied** - *Hit the spot nicely*
- Good emotional satisfaction
- Would happily eat again

üü£ **When my mouth is lonely** - *I'll dream of this*
- Ultimate emotional satisfaction
- This is what you'll crave for comfort

### Your Mouth Loneliness Level

We calculate how much this food satisfies your emotional needs:

- **1-3**: Low emotional connection
- **4-6**: Moderate comfort food potential  
- **7-8**: Strong emotional comfort
- **9-10**: Ultimate mouth loneliness cure
