## üîó Inter-Agent Communication Protocol

### **Communication Architecture:**
- **Hierarchical Coordination:** All agents report to master coordinator
- **Autonomous Handoffs:** Agents can request assistance from specialists
- **Conflict Resolution:** Automatic escalation with 3-tier resolution
- **Shared Context Memory:** Real-time state synchronization

### **Communication Channels:**
- **Urgent:** Immediate escalation to coordinator (< 30 seconds)
- **Standard:** Coordinator-mediated task distribution
- **Collaborative:** Direct peer-to-peer with oversight logging

### **Autonomous Decision Framework:**
- **Level 1:** Within specialization boundaries (autonomous)
- **Level 2:** Cross-domain collaboration (coordinated)  
- **Level 3:** Major architectural decisions (requires approval)

## üìä Persistent State Management

### **Storage Infrastructure:**
```
.swarm/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ persistent-swarm-config.json    # Agent configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared-context.json             # Cross-agent context
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task-queue.json                 # Priority-based task management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ progress-tracking.json          # Real-time metrics

## üéØ Next Steps

The persistent SPARC swarm is now **fully operational** and awaiting task assignment. You can:

1. **Issue individual tasks** to specific agents based on specialization
2. **Provide complex multi-step projects** for autonomous coordination  
3. **Monitor progress** through real-time status reports
4. **Scale operations** by adding more specialized agents as needed

**Command Interface:**
```bash
# Check swarm status
node .swarm/agent-spawner.js status

# Assign task to specific agent  
node .swarm/agent-spawner.js spawn ui-ux-designer "Update golden theme colors"

# Auto-assign task based on content
node .swarm/agent-spawner.js assign high "Fix authentication routing issue"
```
